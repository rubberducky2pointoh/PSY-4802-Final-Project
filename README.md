The American National Election Surveys (ANES) data was used in the analysis for this study. The attached .zip file includes:
- Excel sheet of the raw data
- Codebook for responses in ANES surveys
These data are accessible through the 2024 ANES website as well: https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2024-time-series-study/

Most code is explained in comments throughout the markdown file. Most of this code is done in base R through RStudio, though there is one pipe included through the tidyverse package.

IMPORTANT: The results and code shown here should only be used for learning material only. Please do not plagiarize my work! (Note to prof: I'm pretty sure this repository is publically accessible. That's why all this is here. We can laugh about this if it's not public!)

INSTALLATION:

The files included can be directly downloaded to the user's computer. It is best to include both the ANES dataset and R Markdown file in the same folder, though as long as the user knows where each file is in their computer, it should be easily accessible.

USAGE:

Analysis of ANES dataset.
