# This is as far as I've gotten as of 11/25/2025.I'm trying to replace the states that voted Republican with 0 and Democrat with 1 so I can use them as binary data. I'm kind of hitting a wall however, since it doesn't seem to want to do that. I have other things I need to do, so I'm taking the hit for now, but help would be greatly appreciated!
